We are still planning our project's details. We are having a
hard time on deciding which method we should use to transmit 
our signals between the gateway(wifi or another device). 
We only used vikipedia and youtube so far. Wifi seems better 
but we are not done yet about our research. We plan to make a 
website for controlling the plugs.
